My sister is getting married and she asked me to make a bunch of name tags for seat placements. I saw the cool project by @LarsPrintingSolution (https://www.printables.com/model/286409-individual-nametag-for-glasses-and-cups-wedding-de) however I wasn't going to manually make and edit dozens of names.

So I made my very first OpenSCAD project‚Ä¶. it combines an SVG I made and some rather manual shifting of the letters for a very specific font ("STIX Two Text" https://fonts.google.com/specimen/STIX+Two+Text ) to come up with this mess of a model :P

And then I wrote a little Python script that goes and generates the whole list of names for me and outputs the STL's.

A few hours of work to save me a couple hours of work? Worth it. Hahahaha

‚úÖ What You Need to Install
1. OpenSCAD
Download and install from here:
https://www.openscad.org/downloads.html
2. Python 3
Download and install from here:
https://www.python.org/downloads/
‚úî Windows users: Be sure to check "Add Python to PATH" during installation!
3. Stix Two Text Font
Download the font:
https://fonts.google.com/specimen/STIX+Two+Text
Click "Download family" and unzip the folder.
Install the STIXTwoText-Regular.ttf font file:
On Mac:
Double-click STIXTwoText-Regular.ttf
Click "Install Font"
On Windows:
Right-click STIXTwoText-Regular.ttf
Select "Install for all users"
üìÅ Download Project Files
Place these three files in a single folder (e.g., STLGenerator):

generateNames.py
templatev2.scad
Clip1.svg
Step 1: Install the Prerequisites
OpenSCAD
Python 3
Stix Two Text font
Step 2: Add Names
Open generateNames.py in a plain text editor.

Mac: Use TextEdit (set to plain text)
Windows: Use Notepad
Advanced users: VS Code, Sublime Text, etc.

Replace the placeholder names with your own.
Original example:

names = [ "THIS", "IS", "A", "LIST", "OF", "NAMES" ]

Your custom names:

names = [ "JEANLUC", "WILL", "WESLEY", "BEVERLY", "DEANNA", "GEORDI" ]

‚úî Tips:

All uppercase works best
Separate names with commas
You can list as many names as you want
Step 3: Test the Setup
On Mac/Linux
Open Terminal
Navigate to your folder:
cd ~/Desktop/STLGenerator
Run the test:
python3 generateNames.py test
On Windows
Open Command Prompt
Navigate to your folder:
cd C:\Users\YourName\Desktop\STLGenerator
Run the test:
python generateNames.py test
‚úî If everything works, you'll see:

OpenSCAD detected
Template file found
Output folder ready
user@M2-MacBook STLGenerator % python3 generateNames.py test
Testing setup...
Using OpenSCAD at: /Applications/OpenSCAD.app/Contents/MacOS/OpenSCAD
OpenSCAD version info:
Template file found: /Users/user/Desktop/STLGenerator/templatev2.scad
Output directory ready: /Users/user/Desktop/STLGenerator/output_stls
All tests passed.
Step 4: Generate Your STL Files
On Mac/Linux
python3 generateNames.py

On Windows
python generateNames.py

The script will create .stl files in a folder called output_stls.

Check the output_stls folder inside your project folder:

STLGenerator/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ generateNames.py
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ templatev2.scad
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Clip1.svg
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ output_stls/    
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ JEANLUC.stl    
         ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ WILL.stl    
         ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...

 

üõ† Troubleshooting
Problem	Solution
OpenSCAD not found	Verify it's installed. On Mac, check /Applications/OpenSCAD.app and add it to your PATH.
Python not recognized	Reinstall Python 3 and ensure "Add Python to PATH" is selected (Windows).
Font not working	Ensure Stix Two Text is installed properly. Restart OpenSCAD if necessary.
Permission denied / access denied	Try running the terminal as Administrator (Windows) or sudo (Mac/Linux).
‚úÖ You're Ready to 3D Print!

Import the .stl files into your slicer software and print your personalized name tags.

Printing Instructions
I printed these using PETG (as I want them to be a little springier).

I sized them down to 70% size, since 100% was a little large for the glasses they were using. I managed to fit about 12-16 on the bed at a time.

Infill: 30%

Layer Height: 0.2mm

Printer: Prusa MK4
